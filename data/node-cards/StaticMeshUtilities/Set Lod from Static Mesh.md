**Inputs:**
- In (exec)
- Target (object)
- Destination Static Mesh (object) — The static mesh to set the LOD in.
- Destination Lod Index (integer) — The index of the LOD to set.
- Source Static Mesh (object) — The static mesh to get the LOD from.
- Source Lod Index (integer) — The index of the LOD to get.
- Reuse Existing Material Slots (boolean) — If true, sections from SourceStaticMesh will be remapped to match the material slots of DestinationStaticMesh when they have the same material assigned. If false, all material slots of SourceStaticMesh will be appended in DestinationStaticMesh.

**Outputs:**
