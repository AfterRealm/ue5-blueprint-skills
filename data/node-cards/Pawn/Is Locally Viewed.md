## Is Locally Viewed
**Category:** Pawn
**Search:** "Is Locally Viewed"
**Target:** Pawn

**Inputs:**
- Target (object)

**Outputs:**
- Return Value (boolean)

**Description:** Is this pawn the ViewTarget of a local PlayerController? Helpful for determining whether the pawn is visible/critical for any VFX. NOTE: Technically there may be some cases where locally controlled pawns return false for this, such as if you are using a remote camera view of some sort. But generally it will be true for locally controlled pawns, and it will always be true for pawns that are being spectated in-game or in Replays.
